# Covid Aware
Open source watchOS app that shows the latest COVID-19 data for the US and each state, powered by [The Covid Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/data). Written 100% in Swift using SwiftUI and Combine.

## Features
- Breakdown for all [reported metrics](https://covidtracking.com/about-data/data-definitions): Total cases, Total deaths, Daily deaths, Daily cases, Current Hospitalization, Current ICU, and more 
- Detailed, interactive, pannable graphs showing changes over time (monthly, weekly, all-time) in each metric
- Jump to any date in the past to see metrics at that point in time
- Automatic daily fetches (even while app is in the background) for new Covid data when it is published, so it's always up to date
- Favorite states so they appear at the top of the states list
